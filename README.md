# Robocomp-ZeroC-JS

Idea: JavaScript support
Mentors: Nicolas Gonzalez Flores and Luis V. Calderita

This repository contains the work done during the GSOC 18. The following posts show detailed information about the process followed to achieve the final goal of integrating JavaScript into RoboComp. To achieve this, the component model of RoboComp has been extended to support components in JavaScript that communicate through the recently added Zeroc ICE support for JavaScript interfaces.

As a sample of the final result, we link two videos that show how the robot works in simulation and in reality.
